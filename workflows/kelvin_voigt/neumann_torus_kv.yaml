neumann_conditions:
  # Apply time-dependent force on outlet (will be controlled by driver)
  # Note: The actual time-dependent force is handled in the driver code
  # This just defines the sideset where force is applied
  - type: sideset
    format: file
    path: torus_geometry/outlet
    value: [0, -2, 0]  # Initial force magnitude (Y direction, downward)
    component: [0, 1, 2]

# Time-dependent loading strategy:
# t < T/3: Apply full load (-10 in Y direction)
# t >= T/3: Remove load (set to 0)
# This creates: loading phase → unloading → free vibration with damping
